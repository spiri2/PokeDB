PokeDB is a Pok√©monGo utility bot that queries data from your RDM database and parses it based on user input. From there it translates the data into a readable format and sends to a discord channel either in text or embed format.

PokeDB also has a webhook listener set up that takes data from external RDM services (ie: other mappers) and parses it in the same way as the other data. Additionally there are admin commands and toggles for most of these functions.
